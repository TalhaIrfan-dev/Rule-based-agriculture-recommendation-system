## 📖 Overview

Agriculture is a key economic sector, yet crop planning decisions are often based on experience or assumptions rather than structured analysis. This frequently results in **crop imbalance**, **inefficient land use**, and **financial loss**.

The **Digital Agriculture Recommender System (DARS)** is a **web-based decision support system** designed to address this challenge by providing **data-driven, rule-based agricultural recommendations**. The system assists farmers by offering structured guidance based on:

- Soil properties  
- Seasonal context  
- Market demand trends  
- Crop disease knowledge  

This project was developed as a **Software Engineering (Semester-03) academic project**, with strong emphasis on:

- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
- **Software Design Specification (SDS)**
- System and UI design planning

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional farming decisions are commonly influenced by previous seasons’ demand, market prices, or neighboring farming practices. When adopted at scale, this approach leads to:

- Overproduction of specific crops  
- Reduced profitability for farmers  
- Poor soil–crop alignment  
- Limited guidance for disease identification and treatment  
- Fragmented agricultural knowledge  

Most existing digital agriculture platforms focus primarily on **marketplaces** or **record keeping**, rather than providing **intelligent decision support**.

**DARS bridges this gap** by offering a **centralized, rule-based agricultural recommendation system** through a single web platform.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design a **rule-based agricultural recommendation system**
- Suggest suitable crops based on **soil type, season, and demand trends**
- Provide **soil–crop suitability analysis**
- Offer guidance for **common crop diseases and treatments**
- Apply professional **software engineering documentation standards**
- Demonstrate **UML, database design, and system architecture concepts**

---

## 🧩 Project Scope

---

## ⚙️ Methods / System Approach

- Rule-based recommendation logic using **IF–THEN rules**
- Spatio-temporal context analysis (season and region concepts)
- Structured Software Engineering workflow:
  - Requirements Analysis  
  - System Design  
  - Use Case Modeling  

> ❌ No Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning techniques are used to maintain transparency and simplicity.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
